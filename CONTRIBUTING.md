Pull requests needs to be send to the master, all checks needs to be green.
The automatic merge is time based depending on GitHub review workflow outcome.

 - `Request changes` reduces the outcome.
 - `Approve` increases the outcome

 If the outcome is negative the merge will not happen. Higher positive outcome
