    <h2>Phase One: Dynamic code ownership</h2>

    <h3>The challenge</h3>

    Open source projects bring transparency and openness since decades.
    Over time certain problems came to light:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Contribution can be frustrating due to unclear processes.</b><br />
        e.g. I had a couple of cases where contributions / Pull Requests were just ignored
        or missing communication or agreements on when to merge between the maintainers.</li>
      <li><b>The power of progress is restricted to a certain group.</b><br />
    Independent on previous contribution the direction of a project is decided
    by a limmited number of people or companies with possibly hidden agendas.</li>
      <li><b>Projects die even with interested contributers</b><br />
    The owner of the projects is not interested anymore or sidetracked and
    doesn't take care of any contributions</li>
      <li><b>Project owner change lead to uncertainties</b><br />
    One of the bad examples <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/">The event-stream incident</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>An idea</h3>

    Establish a contribution based weighted voting system for time base auto merges.<br />
    Nice sentence, what does that mean?<br />
    <br />
    <span>In the following I'm using the github vocabular, I hope this can be easily translated into similar systems</span><br />
    Contributions are presented as Pull Requests, the Pull Requests are automatically
    merged after a certain time by the world driven auto merger.<br />
    Contributors have the possibility to vote for or against the merge by reviewing
    the Pull Request. (Approve / Request changes)<br />
    The weight of the vote depends on previous contributions, more contribution
    more speedup or slow down.<br />
    When a certain threshold on negative points is reached the merge is cancled.<br />
    <h4>Play an example</h4>
    For different projects different configuration could make sense. Just trying
    to explain it better:<br />
    <br />
    So let's play it with 10 days merge duration.<br />
    The weight could be the number of commits on the repository.<br />
    The project itself has 1000 commits.<br />
    <br />
    Alice sends her first Pull Request to some project.<br />
    Bob, one of the active contributors has 400 commits, likes the change and
    approves the changes. The time to merge is reducted by 4 days (400/1000 * 10).<br />
    Carol, new to the project but already 100 commits, doesn't like the
    styling and want to code extracted to methods (Bob doesn't mind). Request changes the merge time to merge
    is increased by one day.<br />
    <br />
    Alice agrees to Carols suggestions, prepares the changes, pushes and the timer is reset due to code changes.<br />
    Bob agrees (-4 days), Carol agrees (-1 day).<br />
    <br />
    <span>I hope you get it ...</span><br />
    5 days pass by, the Pull Request is merged.<br />
    <br />
    Next time Alice has her fair share, too. So she gets some kind of saying
    on the further progress and also some responsibility.<br />

    <h4>Current status</h4>

    The auto merger is working on a couple of projects, on itself of course, too,
    I would say prototype state.

    <br />
    A status check is used to inform about the time to merge and provides a link
    for a detailed breakdown.
    <img src="static/images/merge_at.png" />

    <h4>Why?:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to the clear rules it is easy to see what happens with your PR and
        when it will be merged.</li>
      <li>Some open source projects struggle with their maintainer. This way others
        can still drive the project forward.</li>
      <li>Weighting the votes enables the main contributors the most power to
        stale or block bad PRs or speed things up. On the other hand it can
        motivate to contribute to increase their own weight.</li>
      <li>One fundamental question is the ownership. Currently the owner of the
        project has anyway full control and can stop or speed up everything. It
        would be nice if they don't have to.
    </ul>
    <br />

    I'm pretty sure the system can be tricked with certain behavior, that's not the idea.
    Working on an open source project is collaborating, so most of the tricking
    can easily solved by communication.

    <h4>Current Rules:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>10 days, well more then a week, should give everyone enough time to look into</li>
      <li>per commit: If a PR has multiple commits the time is increased for each commit.
        Having multiple commits on a PR means the feature reaches a certain complexity,
        hence reviewers should have enough time to review it.</li>
      <li>Voting via review: Github reviewing functionality is the perfect place to
        discuss the PR and express the preference. (Gitlab the same, but not yet implemented)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase Two: Transparent services</h2>
    Having clear and automated rules for progressing in open source projects
    is just the base.
    Due to the DevOps (or GitOps) idea many operational tasks are now stored
    in repositories, too, and applied on merge. So the challenge is building
    (worlddriven) services, which are only maintained via Pull Requests.

    This provides a new level of trust and a new entity <i>unavailable system
      data</i> (still searching for a better name).
    Passwords, service credentials, ... is data which does not necessarily be
    accesible by humans. This can be maintained and used only in the system.<br/>
    <br/>
    Example: In one of the company I was working for the employees were using
    chromeboxes. Within their daily work they had to split and merge PDFs.
    There are a lot of (free) services out there which just do the job, but
    they can't be used. What happens with my PDFs, do they store them, do they
    use them. I hope and guess not, but I'm not sure.<br/>
    <br/>
    How about a PDF service, open source, world driven, continous deployment.
    No one has access to any credentials, changes can only be done via public
    Pull Requests. That should be fine?

    <h2>Phase Three: Down the rabbit hole</h2>
    In my mind these examples use
    <ul>
      <li>some CI services for testing and deploy.</li>
      <li>some automated hosting environment (PaaS)</li>
      <li>some databases, ...</li>
    </ul>
    The web service itself is world driven, but can I trust the other parties.
    Why not build the infrastructure world driven, too. Using IaaS instead of
    higher level managed server is a lot to do but doable (I know I built a PaaS).
    World driven fully automated IaaS, IMHO, more challenging, ..., how deep to
    dig?
