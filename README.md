World driven introduces a contribution based weighted voting system
for merging of pull requests. As soon as you contribute to a project, you get a share or
responsibility for the progress of the project.

Github Pull Request are the main contact point. Reviewing a PR with an
'Approve' votes for `yes`, 'Request change' is `no`.

The number of commits on the repository is the weight for the vote.

PRs can be ignore by prefixing the title with `[WIP] `.

If a PR is ready for merge a voting is started (starting `value` 0):
 - If a reviewer 'Request changes' the `value` decreases by their contribution value.
 - If a reviewer 'Approve' the `value` increases by their contribution value.
 - Based on the `value` and `total` of votes is `coefficient` is calculated and
   the PR is merged in `coefficient * (5 + pull_request.commits * 5)) days`.

## Develop

Set `TOKEN` as environment variable and run `python src/server.py`.
For github oauth feature provide `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`,
callback url is `/github-callback`.
Set Session secret as `SESSION_SECRET` initial a random string.

Run tests with: `pytest`

## Production environment

Started on some random server in `screen`, with
`while true; do bash run.sh; done`

Get `GET /restart/` stops the server process and restarted by the command
line command. Super ugly I know, just quickly solved somehow.
