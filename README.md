# democratic-collaboration

Usually in open source projects there is one or more people responsible to finally merge features and fixes in to the master branch. Due lack of time or interest this can be a bottleneck.

Democratic collaboration introduces a contribution based weighted voting system for merging. As soon as you contribute to a project, you get a share or responsiblity for the progress of the project.

Currently it is based on the github Pull Request workflow. If a PR is reviewed with an 'Approve' it is like voting `yes`, 'Request change' is `no`. Review with 'comment' prolongs the time to merge.

Weighted votes are based on the commits (currently).

If a PR is ready for merge a voting is started (starting `value` 0):
 - If a reviewer 'Request changes' the `value` decreases by their contribution value.
 - If a reviewer 'Approve' the `value` increases by their contribution value.
 - Based on the `value` and `total` of votes is `coefficient` is calculated and
   the PR is merged in `coefficient * 10 days`.
